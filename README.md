# Sudoku Game

Created a sudoku game with a GUI and an autosolver (with a backtracing algorithom).

Starting working through a tutorial from TechwithTim to build a backtracking algorithm to solve a sudoku puzzle. 

Then reproduced the base code from {insert github link} to wrap my head around creating a playable suduko GUI using the the pygame library. 

Then customized the code to:
Make the code a bit clearer / easier for me to understand.
Customize the GUI to be more clear and user freindly.
Created the functionality to autogenerate a new game.
Added a buttom with hover for creating a new game.
