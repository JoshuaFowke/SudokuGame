# Sudoku Game

Created a sudoku game with a GUI and an autosolver (with a backtracking algorithom).

Leverages pygame module.

Starting working through a tutorial by TechwithTim (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqUwSA0xI-s&t=871s) to build a backtracking algorithm to solve a sudoku puzzle. 

Then used the code from https://github.com/techwithtim/Sudoku-GUI-Solver/blob/master/solver.py as a starting point to wrap my head around creating a playable suduko GUI using the pygame library. 

I reproduced similar code and then customized that code to:
1. Make the code cleaner / easier for me to understand.
2. Signifigantly changed the GUI to be more clear and user freindly.
3. Created the functionality to auto generate a new game.
4. Added a button with hover for creating a new game.
